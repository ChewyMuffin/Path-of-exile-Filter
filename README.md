# Path-of-exile-Filter
This Repository contains a script used in path of exile to filter out certain items.
This is a simple filter script that filters out invaluable items for general users. It only enhances the visual appearances 
sound effects for certain items. Hardcore leveling or professional players should look for more specific versions
to suit their needs.

Installation instruction:
(it will be posted on Path of exile forum as well)

1) copy and past the codes into a blank text document, and save the document as a filter file.
(If the filters' extensions are not shown, you might have to change the setting under folder option. Instruction to
change the setting varies depending on which version of the windows your computer has.)

2) Once it is saved, transfer the document to your path of exile file.
 (To navigate to the file, simple follow the following path:
  My computer or This PC -> Local Disk(c): -> Users -> Your username -> Documents -> My Games -> Path of Exile.

3) Start your game.

4) Once your game is loaded, open up the option menu. Select the UI tap and scroll to the bottom.
  (If the menu does not contain an option for you to load the script, it could mean:
  1) You did not change your file's extension to .filter.
  2) you did not save the file to the correct file. Double check to see you did both requirements correctly.

5) When it is successful loaded, the game should tell you the file has been sucessfull loaded, and it
   should work as intended.
